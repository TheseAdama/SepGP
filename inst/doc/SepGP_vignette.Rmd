## I. Description

The `SepGP` package is designed to model a spatio-temporal function represented by

$$f : (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{R} \mapsto f(x,t) \in \mathbb{R},$$

and assumed to be observed for each point \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) at discretization times \( t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N_{t}} \).

The main features of the `SepGP` package include:

- **Model Construction**: Create Gaussian Process models with separable covariance functions tailored to the data structure.

- **Parameter Optimization**: Use a Leave-One-Out cross-validation method combined with maximum likelihood estimation to optimize model parameters.

- **Prediction**: Make predictions for new spatial points and all discretization times \( t_{1}, \ldots, t_{N_{t}} \).

## II. Main Functions

### a) SepGP: Separable Gaussian Process Object

The `SepGP` function allows the creation of an object of class `SepGP`, initializing a Gaussian process model with customizable prior covariance and mean structures, along with an optional nugget effect.

#### Usage
  `SepGP(D, FD, s, covtype, phi, nugget)`

#### Parameters

- **`D`**: Design of experiments containing the spatial points.

- **`FD`**: Matrix of function evaluations at **D**.

- **`s`**: Degree of the polynomial for the prior mean function.

- **`B`**: (Optional) Matrix of regression coefficients for the prior mean. If not specified, a matrix consisting of ones is used by default.

- **`covtype`**: Type of spatial covariance function, with a default value of `"gauss"`. Acceptable values are `"gauss"`, `"exp"`, `"matern3_2"`, and `"matern5_2"`.

- **`phi`**: (Optional) Hyperparameter vector for the covariance function. If not specified, a vector of ones is used by default.

- **`philow`**: (Optional) Lower bounds for the hyperparameter `phi`. If not specified, a vector consisting of `0.1` is used by default.

- **`phiup`**: (Optional) Upper bounds for the hyperparameter `phi`. If not specified, a vector consisting of `10` is used by default.

- **`Sigmat`**: (Optional) Temporal covariance matrix (for discretization times). If not specified, an identity matrix of appropriate size ($N_{t} \times N_{t}$) is used by default.

- **`nugget`**: (Optional) A small positive value added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix to improve numerical stability, with a default value of `1e-16`.

#### Value

- **`gp`**: An object of class `SepGP` representing a Gaussian process model with the specified parameters.

### b) Covmat: Calculate the Covariance Matrix for SepGP

This function computes the covariance matrix between two design of experiments based on a `SepGP` model.

#### Usage
  `Covmat(object, D1, D2)`

#### Parameters

- **`object`**: An object of class `SepGP`.

- **`D1`**: First Design of Experiments.

- **`D2`**: Second Design of Experiments.

#### Value

- **`Cmat`**: Covariance matrix between **D1** and **D2**.

### c) PriorMean: Calculate the Prior Mean for SepGP

The `PriorMean` function computes the prior mean for a given design of experiments (`Dnew`) based on an existing `SepGP` model. It constructs a polynomial prior mean function using the coefficients and degree specified in the `SepGP` object.

#### Usage
  `PriorMean(object, Dnew)`

#### Parameters

- **`object`**: An object of class `SepGP`, representing a Gaussian process model with a separable covariance structure.

- **`Dnew`**: A matrix representing a new design of experiments (DOE) for which the prior mean will be computed.

#### Values

- **`M`**: A matrix representing the prior mean values at each point in **Dnew**.

- **`H`**: A matrix where each row corresponds to the values of the polynomial basis functions evaluated at a point in `Dnew`.

### d) GPoptim: SepGP Model parameters Optimization

The `GPoptim` function optimizes the hyperparameters of a given `SepGP` model. This includes tuning the spatial covariance function parameters, the temporal covariance matrix, and the coefficients matrix associated with the prior mean function. Optimization is achieved using a combination of leave-one-out cross-validation and maximum likelihood estimation methods, providing a robust fit for the model.

#### Usage
  `GPoptim(object, maxit)`

#### Parameters

- **`object`**: An object of class `SepGP`, representing a Gaussian process model with a separable covariance structure.

- **`maxit`**: (Optional) An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm (refer to the `optim` function in the `stats` package for details). The default value is 100. You should choose a reasonable value for maxit based on the dimensionality of the hyperparameters of the spatial covariance function.

#### Values

An optimized `SepGP` object with updated hyperparameters:

- **`phi`**: Optimal values for the covariance hyperparameters.

- **`B`**: Estimated coefficient matrix derived from the optimized hyperparameters.

- **`Sigmat`**: Estimated temporal covariance matrix.

### e) predictSepGP: Make Predictions Using a SepGP Model 

This function computes the posterior mean and covariance matrix for for new spatial points based on a `SepGP` model.

#### Usage
  `predictSepGP(object, Dpred, covcompute)`

#### Parameters

- **`object`**: An object of class `SepGP`, representing a Gaussian process model with a separable covariance structure.

- **`Dpred`** : A new design of spatial points for which predictions are to be made.

- **`covcompute`** : A logical value indicating whether the posterior covariance should be computed. The default value is `TRUE`.

#### Values
A list with the following elements:

- **`Mean`**: Posterior mean vector of the predictions for each new input in `Dpred`.

- **`Covsp`**: Spatial posterior covariance matrix of the predictions.

- **`Covmat`**: Posterior covariance matrix of the predictions, quantifying the uncertainty for each point in `Dpred`.

## III. Discussion

The `SepGP` package is particularly effective in cases where separability is justified, such as when a separability test confirms its suitability. However, it currently supports a limited range of covariance functions, specifically isotropic Gaussian, exponential, and Mat√©rn kernels (with smoothness parameters $\nu=3/2$ and $\nu=5/2$).

The optimization process in `SepGP` is based on a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) approach. While this method is generally reliable, it can be time-consuming, especially for cases with high spatial dimensionality and/or large numbers of discretized time points.
